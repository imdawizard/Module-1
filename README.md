# Module-1 challenge

Description:
  This site is a modified version of a starter code freely given for instructional purposes. The original code was designed to teach 3 concepts: correct HTML, consolidated CSS, and alt names.

#HTML
  The original code was given with a broken link in the header, this was fixed by adding a id to the first anchor element located first in the header.

#CSS
  The OG code had very long and repeated CSS elements that could be consolidated and reorganized to more reflect the design of the corresponding HTMl.

 #ALT names
    None of the images were given ALT names, which are crucial for screen readers in addition for the site to have more traction by search engines by google. Alt names were given for all available images.
